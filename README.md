# swift-local-notify-mcp
This is a barebones example of an MCP server running in Swift, demonstrating integration with Cursor. The server enables Cursor to display native macOS dialog boxes with customizable title and text messages. It is intended to just be a reference example that can be extended to unlock many different automations with MCP on macOS.
